# Object oriented programming in Python

* **Status:** In Progress
* **Focus:** Class,Instances,Class Variables,Methods(Regular,Class,Static),Inheritance,special methods (Magic Dunder),Property Decoraters (Getters , Setters and Deleters).

## What I learned
* **Class:** Class is a blueprint or template.It defines the structure(attribute) and behavior(methods) for the object.
* **Instance:** The Object build using the class.
* **Class Variables:** Class variable's are different from Instance variable's.A Class Variable is shared by all the Instances in the class and are accessible throughout the class.
* **Methods:** Learnt about the implementation and Difference between Regular,Class,and Static methods in Classes.
**Class Methods:** This class methods can override the regular methods in the main class without disturbing the whole code.
**Static Method:** This static methods are method that logically belong to a class but does'nt need access to either the instance(self) or the class(cls).
**Encapsulation:** The internal state of an object should not be freely modifiable.All changes must go through controlled paths.
