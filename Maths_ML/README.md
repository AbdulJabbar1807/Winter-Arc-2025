# Matrices in python

**Status:** In Progress
**Focus:** Matrices in python,Different algorithm's and Processes.

# What I learned
* **Identifying type of Matrices:**How a code fragment that traps  for different types of special matrices before calling the python  inversion routine, and classifies the type of special case encountered.
* **Gram Schmidt Process:** To make the Orthogonal Matrices that is making the vectors orthogonal(perpendicular to each other) by reducing there overlap using the GramSchmidt process.
